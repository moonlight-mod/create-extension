# create-extension

This tool scaffolds a new [moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight) extension. It replaces the deprecated [sample-extension](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/sample-extension) repository.

**For creating a new moonlight extension, [follow the documentation](https://moonlight-mod.github.io/ext-dev/getting-started) instead.**

## Template features

- Configured like a monorepo, so multiple extensions can live in the same Git repository
- Pre-configured build system (esbuild)
- Pre-configured formatter and linter (Prettier and ESLint)
- TypeScript support
- Sample extension that shows off many moonlight features
